  Activities affected by this alert.

  If an entity is a station platform, and the alert only impacts those boarding at that platform and no one else, and \
  the activity `"BOARD"` represents customers boarding at the informed entity, then the entity includes `activities` \
  `["BOARD"]`. If the alert affected customers exiting at the platform too, then `activities` is `["BOARD", "EXIT"]`.

  It should be noted that the `activities` array includes activities that are specifically affected. Thus if there \
  were activities `"BOARD"`, `"EXIT"`, and `"USING_WHEELCHAIR"` [to board or exit], and a station were closed, then \
  the `activities` array would include `"BOARD"` and `"EXIT"` but it would not be necessary to include the activity \
  `"USING_WHEELCHAIR"`. Any rider entering the station who is `"USING_WHEELCHAIR"` is also a rider who `"BOARD"`s. \
  Using a wheelchair to board is not specifically affected.
