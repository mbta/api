# V3 API

To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install required **Erlang** and **Elixir** versions:
     1. Install [**asdf**](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) package manager
     2. Run `asdf plugin-add erlang` to add Erlang plugin
     3. Run `asdf plugin-add elixir` to add Elixir plugin
     4. Run `asdf install` to install plugin versions speicifed in `.tool-versions` file
  2. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  3. Setup `apps/api_accounts` following directions in `apps/api_accounts/README.md` (on [GitHub](apps/api_accounts/README.md#setting-up-dynamodb-local) or [ExDoc](api_accounts-readme.html#setting-up-dynamodb-local))
  4. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
